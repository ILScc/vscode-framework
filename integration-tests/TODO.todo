Test these cases:
stop = stop at [build] in console
- start -> stop -> ensure map -> build -> ensure no map
- start -> ensure map -> change config (esbuild.development.sourcemap: false) -> ensure no map
- start -> on build -> 100ms -> change package.json: remove configuration prop -> ensure generated changed
- build -> fails on ts errors

It might become hard to test:
- config.development.closeWindowOnExit = false
