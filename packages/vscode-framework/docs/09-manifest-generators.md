# Manifest Generators

They're generating parts of package.json that is used for launching / publishing the extension.

The original intention of manifest generators is to let you to not repeat yourself (ex: commands in `activationEvents`) and generate some properties from external files (ex: maintain `configuration` in external TS file)

> IDs are not generated by manifest generators, they're "restored" when manifest is read

You can look at [set of builtin generators](../src/cli/manifest-generator/manifestGenerators.ts), they're all enabled by default.

<!-- TODO replace above with auto-generated table -->

## Disabling Generators

See [`config.disablePropsGenerators`](../src/config.ts)

## Custom Generators

> WIP

For example. Sometimes you need to generate `activationEvents` dynamically at build time.

`config.extendPropsGenerators`
<!-- TODO! -->
